            <h2>Feb. 25Astra Rocket 3.0 • DARPA Launch Challenge 1</h2>
<p>Launch window: 2030-2330 GMT (3:30-6:30 p.m. EST)</p>
<p>Launch site: Pacific Spaceport Complex, Kodiak Island, Alaska</p>
<p>Astra Space’s Rocket 3.0 will lift off on its first orbital launch attempt under the auspices of DARPA’s Launch Challenge. The DARPA Launch Challenge aims to incentivize a launch company to demonstrate responsiveness and flexibility by launching two missions from two different launch pads (both at the same spaceport) into two different orbits in a one-month span, with just days of advance notice. On the first mission of the DARPA Launch Challenge, Astra’s Rocket 3.0 will attempt to deliver a Prometheus CubeSat into orbit for the U.S. military and two ARCE CubeSats from the University of South Florida to test inter-satellite communications links. A Space Object Automated Reporting Systems payload will remain attached to the Astra Rocket 3.0’s upper stage. [Feb. 20]</p>
